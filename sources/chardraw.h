/**
 ** Description of struct TextPar (used for internal font drawing):
 **
 ** A character size is defined by its WIDTH and HEIGHT.
 ** The distance from char. to char. is given by SPACE, from
 ** text line to text line by LINE.
 ** WIDTH, SPACE are fractions of the P1,P2 window width,
 ** SPACE, LINE  are fractions of the P1,P2 window height.
 ** The writing direction is DIR, which is the angle [0,2*M_PI]
 ** between text line & x direction.
 ** Set SLANT to an angle != 0 if characters are to appear e.g. italics-like.
 ** Stroked fonts selectable by setting FONT to > 0
 **      (not yet supported).
 **
 ** NOTE: struct TextPar was inherited from former project "plib" (a plot
 **       library which also featured character drawing). It was not
 **       designed from scratch for the purpose of HP-GL font management.
 **       However, for charset 0 it does a fair job here, mainly because
 **       plib itself had been inspired by HP-GL.
